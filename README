This project attempts to compile and link a "single" static library
of CLHEP (http://cern.ch/clhep) using the maven-nar-plugin.

The checkout of this project ONLY contains the file(s) necessary
to compile with NAR. The sources you need to overlay for the 
clhep version you want to compile. 

Run "mvn" and look for the static library in (for example):

2.0.4.5/target/nar/gnu/x86_64-MacOSX-g++/target/lib/libCLHEP.a

This example was (for the moment) only tested on x86-MacOSX-g++.
